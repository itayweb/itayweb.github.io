        <h3 style = "text-align:left">Welcome to my own website,<br>This website is about my hobby, and things to do.</h3>
        <h3 style = "text-align:left">My hobby is to develop things like: Games, Apps, Websites and more...<br>In the last 2 months I have been trying to develop a game.
        <h3 style="text-align:left">At first, I started developing in Visual Studio By Microsoft in Monogame based on Xna which is a Framework (kind of game engine) and its written with C#.</h3>
        <h3 style = "text-align:left">Everything was fine, I made the character moving with animations, I made menu system, I made custom cursor.
        <h3 style = "text-align:left">But when I am trying to make the map, I just couldn't make it, I was searching in the Internet how to make it, but I couldn't find something working.
        <h3 style = "text-align:left">So here's some images of this game: 
        <br><img src="/game-images/game1.PNG">
        <br><img src="/game-images/game2.PNG">
        <br><img src="/game-images/game3.PNG">
        <h3 style="text-align:left">So I decided to leave this project and searching for another game engine to make the game.</h3>
        <h3 style = "text-align:left">So I found game engine called Unity that is very popular.
        <h3 style = "text-align:left">But also in this game engine I had a problem, the character was kind of sliding on the map.
        <h3 style="text-align:left">So I decided to leave this project also and searching for another game engine.</h3>
        <h3 style = "text-align:left">So I found game engine called Unreal Engine 4 (or in short UE4) by Epic Games and written in C++ and unique language called UnrealScript, there are lots of titles which made with this game engine like: Fortnite, PlayerUnkown's Battlegrounds(PUBG), Gears Of War 4, and lots of more...
        <h3 style = "text-align:left">So far I made in this game engine player that can move with abillities, health and mana(skills usage bar) system, and some dummy enemies.
        <h3 style = "text-align:left">I am planning to make a world as big as I can, also I am planning to make quest system, enemy system, and more...
        <h3 style = "text-align:left">Here's images of my currently game(currently the world and the real game is in diffrent projects):
        <br><img src="/game-images/game4.PNG">
        <br><img src="/game-images/game5.PNG">
        <br><img src="/game-images/game6.PNG">
        <h3 style = "text-align:left">The map wasn't build by mine, it was built by Epic Games thems selfs.
        <h4 style="text-align:center">Made by Itay Adler</h4>
